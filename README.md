machine_learning
================

This repo contains a collection of IPython notebooks detailing various machine learning algorithims. In general, the mathematics follows that presented by Dr. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course taught at Stanford University and Christopher M. Bishop's "Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning". Unless otherwise noted, the Python code is orginal and any errors or ommissions should be attribued to me and not the aforemention authors.
